        "One of the easiest way to store data is using a file. You can see the file through Explorer (for Windows). A file has a name (generally it includes an extension) and a byte sequence. An operating system identifies what the file type is by the extension and a part of the byte sequence (It is called \"Magic Number\". we'll explain in Reverse Engineering).\n",
